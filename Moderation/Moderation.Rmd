## Moderation

Create some artificial data:

```{r}
weight <- data.frame(
  Exercise = as.factor(c(rep("Cardio", 10), rep("Weights", 11))), 
  Diet = as.factor(c(rep("A", 5), rep("B", 5), rep("A", 6), rep("B", 5))), 
  WeightLoss = c(17.4, 21.5, 23.6, 21.9, 20.5, 5.9, 4.8, 6.4, 6.8, 6.9, 
                 10.9, 4.2, 9.4, 10, 9.2, 10.1, 9.8, 12.7, 14.4, 11.6, 8.3))
head(weight)
tapply(weight$WeightLoss, list(weight$Exercise, weight$Diet), mean)
weight.aov <- aov(WeightLoss ~ Exercise + Diet + Exercise:Diet, data = weight)
summary(weight.aov)
TukeyHSD(weight.aov)
interaction.plot(weight$Diet, weight$Exercise, weight$WeightLoss)
# Do the same thing with ggplot2 now
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(data = weight, aes(x = Diet, y = WeightLoss, colour = Exercise, group = Exercise, linetype = Exercise)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "line") +
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("purple", "skyblue1")) + 
  labs(y = "Weight Loss (lbs.)")
p1
p2 <- ggplot(data = weight, aes(x = Exercise, y = WeightLoss, colour = Diet, group = Diet, linetype = Diet)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point") +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "line") +
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("purple", "skyblue1")) + 
  labs(y = "Weight Loss (lbs.)")
p2
# Different approach now "Moderation"
weight.aov.cardio <- aov(WeightLoss ~ Diet, data = subset(weight, subset = Exercise == "Cardio"))
summary(weight.aov.cardio)
# Same as:
weight.aov.cardio <- aov(WeightLoss ~ Diet, data = weight[weight$Exercise == "Cardio", ])
summary(weight.aov.cardio)
by(weight$WeightLoss[weight$Exercise == "Cardio"], weight$Diet[weight$Exercise == "Cardio"], mean)
TukeyHSD(weight.aov.cardio)
#
weight.aov.weights <- aov(WeightLoss ~ Diet, data = weight[weight$Exercise == "Weights", ])
summary(weight.aov.weights)
by(weight$WeightLoss[weight$Exercise == "Weights"], weight$Diet[weight$Exercise == "Weights"], mean)
TukeyHSD(weight.aov.weights)
```


```{r}
by(weight, weight$Exercise, function(x)list(summary(aov(WeightLoss ~ Diet, data = x)), TukeyHSD(aov(WeightLoss ~ Diet, data = x))))
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
DF <- summarise(group_by(weight, Diet, Exercise), MeanWeightLoss = mean(WeightLoss))
DF
ggplot(data = DF, aes(x = Exercise, y = MeanWeightLoss, fill = Diet)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "skyblue1")) + 
  labs(title="Exercise Type Moderates the Relationship\nBetween Diet Type and Weight Loss", x = "", y = "Weight Loss (lbs.)")
```
